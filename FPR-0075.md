Also promoting the care of the environment by selling bottles (plastic) the money raised, I realize the conversion of USD / BCH, I also buy bottles (plastic) and payment in bitcoin cash.

**Other:**
Thank you for your attention and time a greeting to the entire team of BitcoinCashFund and thank you for the creation of this project and foundation that promote the use of Bitcoin Cash.

I am lover of the cryptocurrencies to say that 30% fiat and 70% cryptocurrencies fond of Bitcoin Y Bitcoin Cash.

Governments and their &quot;programas sociales&quot; the only thing, are diverted from funds and theft, beneficiandoce themselves causing more problems in countries. &quot; as a result we have violence, lack of food, lack of resources, lack of education in the new generations. and worst of all wars, sorry for the word, but is the best shit that there is (a Government and said better that what they do is too disgusting like the banks)
Putting limits on support to the other brothers in different Nations thanks to the banks that limit us to a transaction but thanks to blockchain technology and low commissions of bitcoin cash this is possible, it is possible to assist our brothers, in Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, South Sudan and between all people and countries. and various projects

I have always wanted to perform this regulation of the crypto (bone the used lie of them in our daily life) Vale4Evolution inspired us @Coins4Clothes with your project, then we met eathBch and wow wanted to join us and create this great project.
