**Project Name:**
Bitcoin in 140 African languages

**FPR Id:**
0078

**Start Date:**
6/4/2018

**Hashtag:**
#BitcoinIn140

**Name of BCF Gitter community room:**
#proj-bitcoinIn140AfricanLanguages

**Stakeholders:**
In so far, I have just conceived the idea. I hope to bring in more people once the project receives funding.

**Project Summary:**
Majority of Africans do not know what Bitcoin in. The few who do are typically the educated types,as such the use of Bitcoin in Africa is not as prevalent compared to other continents.

The messaging about what Bitcoin is is complex. Not everyone understands the crypto business without being scientific. Out project intends to explain to people in Africa in their native languages in You Tube tutorial videos what Bitcoin is. From Swahili to Zulu, all the major 140 languages in Africa.

**Resources:**
The simplicity of our idea is brilliant. We want to start an online video submission content for Bitcoin users in Africa. The goal is to give a5 minute run down of what Bitcoin is in native language. ENGLISH SUBMISSIONS NOT ACCEPTED. The videos which will be selected will be edited and posted on you tube as one 2 hr clip called Bitcoin in 140 African languages.

Of course to draw people to the competition there must be a price.

We will definately require a skilled editor to edit the submissions into one 2 hour clip.

**Budget:**
Competition Price-2000
5 Editor-Each paid 1000usd.
Website for submission/development etc 1000
Licensing for broadcast fee in host country (Kenya) 1000
Traveling 300
Miscellenous 400

Total cost usd 5700


**Timeline:**
We hope to kick start the project in July 2018 running for 2 months.

**Goals:**
We want to reach across the divide of 140 language natives in Africa. A good number for us will be a million people in Africa in a simple and innovative way.

Most of the people we want to reach and the uneducated lot in Africa. And our reason is simple, Bitcoin is a great alternative to paper money.

**Other:**
Mobile payment platforms have revolutionized Africa because they are simple and easy to use. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to learn how to send and receive money.

Bitcoin has the same potential but the messaging is terrible. More so in Africa, it sounds to many people as an alien thing. There is block chain to understand, wallets,exchanges etc. It is so convulated that it you spend 5 minutes explaining to someone what Bitcoin is they will lose interest.

A good way to address this is give messaging in languages people understand. In Africa we say, &quot;We never dream in English&quot;. It is not our language. People tend to understand things better in their native language. Demystify Bitcoin from what it is majorly is-a complex internet thing.
