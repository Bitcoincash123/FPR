**Project Summary:**
Our names are Miguel Angel Chacon, web programmer, and Manuel Rangel, Journalist, both young Venezuelans and enthusiasts of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. The current situation in Venezuela is no secret to anyone. For 18 years, the government has been increasing control over the economy, generating the worst economic crisis in our history. However, crises are opportunities. The monetary restrictions and the hyperinflation of the Bolivar have made that some citizens see in cryptocurrencies a very interesting option to protect the value of their savings and work.

In this sense, we want to be Ambassadors of Bitcoin Cash in our city, Venezuela&#39;s capital, and create an organization called “Bitcoin Cash Caracas” to promote its adoption and spread its benefits and applications. We&#39;ll do this organizing monthly meetings and events to share our knowledge about cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and encourage the adoption by citizens, merchants and companies of Bitcoin Cash.

We want that the original spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto enters in all Venezuelans in order to break the chains of fiat money and the control of the banks and the government. We are certain that Bitcoin Cash will give to the citizens the true monetary freedom. Also our organization, and the audiovisual content we want to produce (videos and photos from the conferences and from businesses which adopt BCH) could be an example to other similar projects in the rest of Venezuela, and Latin America. We want to turn Venezuela into the first Bitcoin Cash nation in the world.

**Resources:**
We need the support of the Bitcoin Cash Fund and the attention of the Bitcoin Cash community to carry out this project, providing the resources to rent Conference rooms, internet services, sound and video equipments, catering for all the attendants, BCH giveaways (a small amount in order to encourage and educate the attendants about the use of Bitcoin Cash through transfer examples in wallets and the use of exchanges. Also giveaways that we&#39;ll give during the events for contests), translations to english services, POP material (brochures, Business Cards, BCH stickers, Posters and Banners, T-shirts, others) for advertising, and payment for the communications, protocol and logistic teams.

All the conferences will be held on saturdays: tentative dates and topics of the conferences.

October 6  3rd Conference: Bitcoin Cash mining and the science of trading.

November 3 : First Bitcoin Cash Mall (A big entrepreneurship fair where small businesses of food, clothes, accessories, etc, will be sold by our &quot;Bitcoin Cash Adopters&quot;)


**Goals:**
Who you want to reach: Taking Bitcoin Cash to Venezuelan citizens, entrepreneurs, merchants, shopping malls, and companies, and teach them on the benefits of Bitcoin Cash over other cryptocurrencies, along with topics related to blockchain technology and the cryptoeconomy. Also, we want to teach how to download a BCH wallet, how to receive payments and send payments in BCH, and everything related to the payment of taxes based on Venezuelan law.

How many people you want to reach: The conferences in the first stage will be organized to have 100 people. However, we want to broadcast our events live through social networks, and also we want to produce audiovisual material, so our reach could be of thousands of people. Not just venezuelans, but all spanish speaker communities, and also, we will translate all our material to english, to spread our activities in all the Bitcoin Cash Community, and Cryptoenthusiasts in all the world. 

 Where are the people you want to reach: In the first stage Mainly in Caracas, Venezuela&#39;s Capital, but later, in other stages we want to encourage the creation of other working teams in all the cities and states, and thus bring the adoption of Bitcoin Cash to all the nation. So, we could make BCH the most widely used cryptocurrency in the country.

Why you want to reach them: As we have already mentioned, our great objective beyond the educational work
in relation to this new technological and financial paradigm represented by the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, is to turn Venezuela into the first Bitcoin Cash nation in the world, in which our citizens can acquire products and services with BCH, protecting their savings and the value of their work from the hyperinflation of the bolivar, and demonstrating that cryptocurrencies are without a doubt the alternative to fiat money and the future of the economy.

Other goals:-Looking for and encouraging young Venezuelan talents who are interested in web development, Javascript and other applications to guide them in their studies, so that in the future they can work in blockchain development, and even the best can collaborate with the Bitcoin Cash Dev Team.

-In other stages, going to schools and low-income communities to teach them about the basics of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and in the future, work with foundations and non-governmental organizations to implement social assistance programs.
